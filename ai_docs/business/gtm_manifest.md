# 5. Go-to-Market Strategy

## Target Channels

P2P merchants spend 8+ hours daily on Telegram — both for trading and community. They're practical, profit-focused, and skeptical of tools that don't show immediate ROI.

**Discovery channels:** Telegram groups (P2P trading communities 30K-100K+ members), YouTube (P2P arbitrage tutorials), Twitter/X (crypto trading threads), Exchange forums (Binance Square, OKX community)

## Marketing Strategy (Prioritized)

### 1. Telegram-First Approach

- Create free "P2P Merchant Tools" channel with genuinely useful content (margin calculators, exchange policy updates, pricing tips)
- Share free Google Sheet template for trade tracking — captures leads who need a better solution
- Soft-sell MerchantDex as the "upgraded version" of the free template

### 2. Content SEO

- Blog posts targeting: "P2P trading profit calculator," "Binance P2P CSV export," "how to track OTC trades," "P2P trading tax reporting"
- Free tools: Online margin calculator, CSV merger tool — capture leads

### 3. Direct Outreach

- Identify active verified merchants on P2P platforms (public profiles)
- Personalized Telegram DM: "Saw you're a Gold merchant on Binance — built a tool that might save you hours on profit tracking. Want a free trial?"

### 4. Referral Program

- Existing users refer other merchants
- Reward: 1 month free for referrer + 50% off first month for referee

## Purchasing Behavior

**Payment method:** USDT/USDC strongly preferred (100% crypto-native audience). Wallet connect or manual transfer. Or Stripe

**Decision speed:** Fast — individual decision, no procurement. If they see value in trial, they convert within 7-14 days.

**Trust factors:** Transparent pricing (no hidden fees), data privacy (their trade data is sensitive), active Telegram support (they expect instant responses).

**Churn risk:** Low if tool becomes part of daily workflow. High if onboarding is confusing or CSV import fails.

## Sales Motion

- 100% self-serve signup
- Onboarding flow: Import first CSV within 5 minutes, see profit summary immediately
- Email sequence: Day 1 (welcome + CSV guide), Day 3 (add first private trade), Day 7 (client CRM tips), Day 12 (trial ending)
- Telegram support group for all users — builds community, reduces churn
- Monthly "your profit report" email — creates habit, shows value

# 6.  Research & Quotes

"Binance P2P is a good way to make extra money. I just would like you to fix the transaction history to export to EXCEL, the actual one is very complicated, for better tax report.”

"I am self employed crypto trader... if I repeat the same process over the month, I would have spent roughly £150,000 monthly volume, profit can be £4,000-5,000... in this case, how do I file tax?”

"Rakesh had sold crypto tokens worth Rs 98,500 through peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions for about Rs 100,000 back in 2022, making a meagre profit of Rs 1,500 on this sale... A few weeks ago, he received a notice from the income tax department flagging his Rs 100,000 deposit... the official asked him to pay 78% or Rs 78,000 in fine on a Rs 1,500 profit.”
